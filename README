Project description: This project is a two dimensional running game currently
where you can run and jump with the ASDW keys and sprint with the shift key. 

All images for this project I got from the internet I edited them to make them
work better for my project.

For my final project I am hoping to be able to make some sort of combination
between mario and a rambo dog. I would like the dog to be able to run around
and shoot bad guys with a gun strapped to his back. Possibly adding multiple 
platforms would be a nice way to improve this so its not just on one level.
